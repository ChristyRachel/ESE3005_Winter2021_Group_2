This is a game called Game of life, which is a zero-player game designed by John Conway.

Rules for Game of Life:
1. if a cell is dead but surrounded by exactly three live neighbours, it sprouts to life (birth)
2. if a cell is live but has more than 3 live neighbours, it dies (overpopulation)
3. if a cell is live but has fewer than 2 live neighbours, it dies (underpopulation)
all other dead or live cells remain the same to the next generation (i.e., a live cell must have exactly three neighbours to survive)
